# Web Application for Online Shopping Experiment by Dr.Ubel.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

All the files you are interested in modifying should be in the src or images directory. The application follows a conventional flux architecture presented in the [React Flux Cart Tutorial](https://github.com/scotch-io/react-flux-cart).

On top of the create-react-app boilerplate and the flux architecture, other core modules/libraries used in the development process include React Router, Underscore, React Bootstrap, and of course, jQuery.
